# Timeserie Keras RNN Timeseries
This Python project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) based Recurrent Neural Networks to forecast (predict) timeseries using Keras + Theano. We compare the results produced by each of these deep neural networks with those from a linear regression model.

<b>Dataset:</b> <a href = "https://datamarket.com/data/set/235j/number-of-daily-births-in-quebec-jan-01-1977-to-dec-31-1990#!ds=235j&display=line"> Number of daily births in Quebec, Jan. 01 '77 - Dec. 31 '90 (Hipel & McLeod, 1994) </a>

## Usage
I suggest you install [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) before trying this out.
```
git clone https://github.com/SCP-173-cool/Keras-RNN-timeseries
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install keras h5py pandas sklearn
python evaluate.py
```


## Architecture & Model Properties
We use Keras' [Sequential](https://keras.io/models/sequential/) model to construct recurrent neural networks. There are 3 layers:
<ul>
<li> Layer 1 : Either a LSTM (with output dimension 10,  and statefulness enabled) layer or a GRU (with output dimension 4) layer.</li>
<li> Layer 2 : A Dropout layer with dropout probability = 0.2, to prevent overfitting. </li>
<li> Layer 3 : A fully-connected Dense Layer with output dimension 1. </li>
<li> Default optimizer: rmsprop; Default # of epochs: 150. </li>
<li> Accuracy Metric: Mean Squared Error. </li>
</ul>
<i>This architecture can certainly further be optimized - I just haven't had the chance to experiment too much thanks to my laptop's constraints! </i>

## Results & Observations
1. The LSTM-RNN model performed the best with a MSE of 1464.78 (look back = 37).
2. Naively making the RNN "deeper" did not yield immediate results; I didn't fine-tune the parameters (output_dim, for example) though. 
3. Making the LSTM network stateful (setting ```stateful=true``` when initializing the LSTM layer) did yield a significant performance improvement though. In stateless LSTM layers, the cell states are reset at each sequence. When ```stateful=true``` however, the states are propagated onto the next batch i.e. the state of the sample located at index ```trainX[i]``` will be used in the computation of the sample ```trainX[i+k]``` in the next batch, where ```k``` is the batch size. You can read more about this at the [Keras docs](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-use-stateful-rnns).
4. Using Glorot initializations yielded a performance improvement. However, using He uniform initialization (Gaussian initialization scaled by fan_in) yielded even better results than with Glorot.
